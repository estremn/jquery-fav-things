        <h1>My favorite things about Javascript</h1>
    </header>

    <ul>

        <li>Jquery</li>
        <p>Jquery makes everything so much easier, neater, and faster.</p>
        <li>Use</li>
        <p>I like how you can use JavaScript to customize, animate, and basically manipulate your site to suit your desires. <br>
        Another cool thing is how widely it's used.</p>
        <li>Versatility</li>
        <p>You can use a variety of different keywords and methods to reach the same end result. Though sometimes this can lead to unneeded confusion.</p>

    </ul>
